# NipperAPI
A repository for my NipperAPI code challenge

Created by: Tristan Canova 4/16

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN:

1. Have NPM and Node.js installed on your computer, if you dont have them installed google them to download. NPM comes bundled with Node.js so if you download Node.js you should have NPM working too! All of the packages used are found in package-lock.json so the command npm install should download them all. You probably need the git commandline if you are on a windows computer to run the commands.

2. Unzip the archived files sent to you by me! 

2. Navigate to the unzipped folder through the command line and run the command: 
    npm install
This will download everything needed to have the webpage and mock API work, also if you have the zipped file it has everything you need to make the webpage work in it already but this will take care of any sort of weirdness!

3. In google chrome go the the web address: localhost:8081
This is where the collection view of the webpage is loaded and has all of the searching and filtering/sorting capabilities! Click on any statue link to be transported to that specific statues api endpoint

4. In google chrome to go to the API endpoint for a statue go to the following web address: localhost:8081/data/:id
Where :id is the name or searched name for a nipper statue that you want to display.

5. Thats it! I hope you enjoy the project, I had no background with creating an API and was pretty rusty with angular so this was alot of fun to figure out how to properly set up! If you have any questions feel free to email me at: tcanova1@gmail.com
